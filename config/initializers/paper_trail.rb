# Deprecation warning:
# Association Tracking for PaperTrail has been extracted to a seperate gem. To use it, please add `paper_trail-association_tracking` to your Gemfile. If you don't use it (most people don't, that's the default) and you set `track_associations = false` somewhere (probably a rails initializer) you can remove that line now

# We did not use it.
#PaperTrail.config.track_associations = false
